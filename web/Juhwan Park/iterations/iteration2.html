      <h1>Iteration 2</h1>
      </br></br></br>
      <p> The part of iteration2 I wrote that I tried to put effort on was the Stamp tool.
        It is one of the tools that takes loads image buffer and overwrite exist pixel buffer based on the dimension of the image loaded, and mouse pointer.
        </p>
      <p><img class="imgleft" src="../files/stamp2.jpg" width="380" height="160" alt="" />
       This snippet is from the stamp tool class, which is the class I wrote for our team.
          The implementation of this is an override of two of the virtual methods from DrawTool class, fillInfluence function, and applyInfluence function, like other tools we implemented during iteration 1.
        The difference with other tool is it takes pixel buffer and actual image's dimension from image loaded. </p>
      </br></br>
      <img class="imgleft" src="../files/stamp1.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="" />
      <p> This code takes image dimension from loadedImageToStamp function. If you see the code,
        it uses ImageHandler() function which wrote by our team member, Jake, to load an image on new buffer, and it also enables to get the actual demension of the loaded image.
        With all of the information, it calls stamp construction and create stamp to be ready.
      </p>
      <p>In this way, this tool contains image pixel buffer, and ready to stamp on the canvas based on mouse pointer as you can see on the screenshot.</p>
