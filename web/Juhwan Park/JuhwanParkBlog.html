      <p> The part of this project I wrote that I tried to start coding in C++ and put more effort on was the Crayon Tool.
        It is one of the tools that takes circle masks and randomly choose pixels to fill the mask.
        So this tool looks pretty rough surface at the edge of each mark it draws.  </p>
      <p><img class="imgleft" src="files/code.jpg" width="400" height="570" alt="" /><p/>
      <p> This snippet is from the Crayon tool class, which is the class I wrote for our team.
        On our final design, we decided to make a DrawTool class to implement basic methods for each tool class, and we inherited each class from DrawTool class.</br></br>
        The implementation of this is an override of one of the virtual methods from DrawTool class, fillInfluence class.
        I followed the basic syntax for all of our applications, as we discussed at the start of our project.
        We decided to use CamelCase variable and function names, brackets on the same lines as their statement and short functions. </p>
      <p> This code takes radius as a parameter and default value is 20. It calculates each distance from center of circle mask,
        and uses standard library function rand() to generate random number between 0 to 1 and put it into each pixel.
        The reason why I multiplied two random 0s and 1s, is because I tried to generate more 0s than 1s to make the surface rougher.
        After that, I put effect by using a random float number in between 0.0 and 1.0 to create random transparency for each pixel.
      <img class="imgright" src="files/screenshot.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="" /> </p>
      <p>In this way, this tool looks rough surface at the edge like crayon.
        Maybe next iteration, I would elaborate some more by putting random transparency into each pixel of mask to look more like real Crayon drawing. </p>
